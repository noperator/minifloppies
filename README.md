# minifloppies
Just a [MinIO](https://min.io/) container running on a Pi and sitting behind an NGINX reverse proxy. But who's got time to configure that? I mean, _I_ did, but I wish someone else had published this already. So here you go.

"minifloppies" is simply the shortest word containing `m.*i.*n.*i.*o` and `p.*i` together in the same string. Plus, it conveniently seemed to fit this application's intended use case.
